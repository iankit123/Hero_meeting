# 🔧 Deepgram Transcription - Final Fix

## 🎯 **Root Cause Identified**

The issue was a combination of THREE problems:

### 1. **Sample Rate Mismatch** ❌
- **Problem**: AudioContext was set to 16kHz, but browser default is 48kHz
- **Fix**: Now uses browser's native sample rate (48kHz) and tells Deepgram to expect it

### 2. **Missing Audio Format Specification** ❌
- **Problem**: Deepgram didn't know what audio format to expect
- **Fix**: Added `encoding=linear16`, `sample_rate=48000`, `channels=1` parameters

### 3. **No Audio Data Logging** ❌
- **Problem**: Couldn't verify if audio was being captured and sent
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive logging to track audio chunks

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. Improved Audio Processing**
```typescript
// Now uses browser's native sample rate (48kHz)
this.audioContext = new AudioContext();

// Logs sample rate for debugging
console.log('🎧 [DEEPGRAM] AudioContext created with sample rate:', this.audioContext.sampleRate);

// Larger buffer for more stable processing
this.processor = this.audioContext.createScriptProcessor(8192, 1, 1);

// Tracks audio chunks being sent
console.log(`🎙️ [DEEPGRAM] Sent ${audioChunkCount} audio chunks`);
```

### **2. Proper Deepgram Configuration**
```typescript
const wsUrl = `wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?` +
  `model=nova-2` +
  `&language=en-US` +
  `&encoding=linear16` +        // ✅ Audio format specification
  `&sample_rate=48000` +         // ✅ Browser's native rate
  `&channels=1` +                // ✅ Mono audio
  `&smart_format=true` +
  `&interim_results=true` +
  `&punctuate=true` +
  `&vad_events=true`;            // ✅ Voice Activity Detection
```

### **3. Enhanced Debugging**
```typescript
// WebSocket state monitoring
if (this.websocket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
  this.websocket.send(pcmData);
} else {
  console.warn('⚠️ [DEEPGRAM] WebSocket not open, state:', this.websocket.readyState);
}

// Audio content detection
const hasSound = audioData.some(sample => Math.abs(sample) > 0.01);
if (hasSound) {
  audioChunkCount++;
}
```

## 🧪 **What You Should See Now**

### **1. Connection Phase**
```
🔗 [DEEPGRAM] Connecting to: wss://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen
🔗 [DEEPGRAM] WebSocket connected
🎧 [DEEPGRAM] AudioContext created with sample rate: 48000
🎵 [DEEPGRAM] Audio processing setup complete
🎧 [DEEPGRAM] Audio graph: MicStream -> Gain -> Processor -> Deepgram WebSocket
📊 [DEEPGRAM] Connection metadata received
```

### **2. Speaking Phase**
```
🎙️ [DEEPGRAM] Sent 50 audio chunks
🎙️ [DEEPGRAM] Sent 100 audio chunks
📥 [DEEPGRAM] Received: Results {...}
🎤 [DEEPGRAM] Raw transcript received: hello world
🎙️ [DEEPGRAM] Sent 150 audio chunks
```

### **3. Keep-Alive**
```
💓 [DEEPGRAM] Sending keep-alive ping
```

## 🎯 **Test Steps**

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Open console** (F12)
3. **Join meeting room**
4. **Look for these logs**:
   - `🎧 AudioContext created with sample rate: 48000`
   - `🎵 Audio processing setup complete`
5. **Start speaking** - you should see:
   - `🎙️ Sent 50 audio chunks` (every ~1.5 seconds of speech)
   - `📥 Received: Results`
   - `🎤 Raw transcript received: your speech`

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If you don't see "Sent X audio chunks":**
- **Problem**: Microphone not working
- **Solution**: Check microphone permissions in browser
- **Test**: Look for `LOCAL AUDIO: ✅ PUBLISHED` in logs

### **If you see "WebSocket not open":**
- **Problem**: Connection closing too fast
- **Solution**: Check Deepgram API key and credits
- **Test**: Look at WebSocket close code in console

### **If you see audio chunks but no transcripts:**
- **Problem**: Deepgram not understanding audio format
- **Solution**: Already fixed with encoding parameters
- **Test**: Look for `📥 Received: Results` messages

## 🎉 **Expected Flow**

```
User speaks → Microphone captures
    ↓
AudioContext processes (48kHz)
    ↓
ScriptProcessor gets audio chunks
    ↓
Convert to PCM16 format
    ↓
Send to Deepgram WebSocket
    ↓
Deepgram processes with nova-2 model
    ↓
Results returned with transcript
    ↓
Display in Live Transcription panel
    ↓
Check for "Hey Hero" trigger
    ↓
Activate AI assistant if triggered
```

## 📊 **Key Improvements**

1. ✅ **Native Sample Rate**: Uses 48kHz (browser default)
2. ✅ **Proper Audio Format**: linear16 PCM encoding
3. ✅ **Audio Chunk Tracking**: Logs every 50 chunks
4. ✅ **WebSocket State Check**: Verifies connection before sending
5. ✅ **Voice Activity Detection**: Deepgram knows when speech starts/ends
6. ✅ **Keep-Alive Pings**: Prevents connection timeout
7. ✅ **Automatic Reconnection**: Recovers from disconnects

## 🎤 **Try It Now!**

1. **Refresh the page**: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Allow microphone access**
3. **Start speaking clearly**: "Hello, this is a test"
4. **Watch console for**:
   - Audio chunk counters
   - Deepgram results
   - Transcript output
5. **Say "Hey Hero" to test full pipeline**

**This should now work perfectly!** 🎉✨
