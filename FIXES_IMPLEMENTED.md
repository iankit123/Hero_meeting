# Fixes Implemented - October 15, 2025

## Summary
Fixed 5 critical issues preventing proper 2-participant testing:
1. ‚úÖ STT transcribing Hero's audio (causing feedback loop)
2. ‚úÖ Duplicate transcripts between participants
3. ‚úÖ Hero LLM refusing to answer general knowledge questions
4. ‚úÖ Speaker names showing UUID instead of display name
5. ‚úÖ Room reference issues in broadcasts

---

## Issue #1: STT Transcribing Hero's Audio ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
Web Speech API was picking up Hero's TTS audio output and transcribing it, causing:
- Hero says: "The capital of India is New Delhi"
- STT transcribes: "the capital of India is new delhi"
- Creates duplicate messages and confusion

### Root Cause
No audio source isolation - STT listens to ALL system audio including speakers

### Solution Implemented
Added `isHeroSpeakingRef` to pause STT during Hero playback:

**File**: `components/MeetingPage.tsx`

```typescript
// Added ref
const isHeroSpeakingRef = useRef(false);

// In STT callback - skip if Hero is speaking
sttServiceRef.current.onTranscript(async (result: STTResult) => {
  if (isHeroSpeakingRef.current) {
    console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è [STT] Skipping transcript - Hero is speaking');
    return;
  }
  // ... process transcript
});

// Before Hero audio plays
isHeroSpeakingRef.current = true;
console.log('‚è∏Ô∏è [STT] Paused - Hero is speaking');

// After Hero audio ends
source.onended = () => {
  isHeroSpeakingRef.current = false;
  console.log('‚ñ∂Ô∏è [STT] Resumed - Hero finished speaking');
};
```

### Impact
- Hero's audio no longer appears in transcripts
- Clean conversation flow
- No feedback loops

---

## Issue #2: Duplicate Transcripts ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
Each transcript appeared twice:
- Participant A says "hello"
- Participant B receives "hello" via broadcast
- Participant B's STT also hears "hello" through LiveKit audio
- Result: "hello" shows twice in both participants' views

### Root Cause
Two sources adding transcripts:
1. Local STT transcribing own audio
2. Receiving broadcast from other participant

### Solution Implemented
Added message ID deduplication:

**File**: `components/MeetingPage.tsx`

```typescript
// Added ref for tracking processed messages
const processedMessageIds = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set());

// In DataReceived handler
if (data.type === 'transcript') {
  // Skip if already processed
  if (processedMessageIds.current.has(data.messageId)) {
    console.log('‚è≠Ô∏è [TRANSCRIPT] Skipping duplicate message:', data.messageId);
    return;
  }
  processedMessageIds.current.add(data.messageId);
  // ... process transcript
}
```

### Impact
- Each message appears exactly once
- Clean transcript view for all participants
- No duplicate detection needed elsewhere

---

## Issue #3: Hero LLM Not Responding ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
Hero responding with "I don't have that specific information" for basic questions:
- Q: "Hero, what is the capital of India?"
- A: "I don't have that specific information"
- Q: "Hero, who is Narendra Modi?"
- A: "I am sorry, but I do not have any information about Narendra Modi"

### Root Cause
Anti-hallucination prompt was TOO restrictive:
- Blocked ALL information not in meeting context
- Even blocked general world knowledge
- Gemini couldn't use its training data

### Solution Implemented
Updated prompt to distinguish between meeting-specific and general knowledge:

**File**: `pages/api/hero-join.ts`

```typescript
const antiHallucinationPrompt = `You are Hero, an AI assistant participating in meetings.

CRITICAL RULES FOR MEETING-RELATED QUESTIONS:
1. When asked about PAST MEETINGS or MEETING PARTICIPANTS: ONLY use context provided
2. NEVER make up meeting details not in context

RULES FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE QUESTIONS:
1. For questions about general facts, world knowledge: provide accurate answers using your general knowledge
2. Examples: "What is the capital of India?" - Answer these normally!
3. You CAN provide general information and factual knowledge
4. Only restrict yourself to context when question is about YOUR meetings

Question: ${finalQuestion}

Determine if this is about:
A) Past meetings (use ONLY context)
B) General knowledge (use your knowledge)

Answer accordingly.`;
```

### Impact
- Hero now answers general knowledge questions correctly
- Still protected against hallucinating meeting details
- Better user experience

## Issue #4: Speaker Names Showing UUID ‚úÖ FIXED

### Problem
Transcripts showing:
- "akshit-233b8265: hello"
- Instead of: "akshit: hello"

### Root Cause
Using `room.localParticipant.identity` (UUID-suffixed) instead of `.name`

### Solution Implemented
**File**: `components/MeetingPage.tsx`

```typescript
// OLD - Using identity
const speakerName = room?.localParticipant?.identity || participantName;

// NEW - Using name
const speakerName = participantName || room?.localParticipant?.name || 'Participant';
```

### Impact
- Clean speaker names in transcripts
- Better readability
- Professional appearance

---

## Issue #5: Room Reference Issues ‚úÖ FIXED (Previous Fix)

### Problem
Room becoming null in callbacks due to React closures

### Solution
Added `roomRef` to maintain current room reference:

```typescript
const roomRef = useRef<Room | null>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  roomRef.current = room;
}, [room]);

// Use roomRef.current instead of room in callbacks
const currentRoom = roomRef.current;
```

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Duplicate Transcripts
**Setup**: 2 separate laptops/browsers

1. Participant A says: "I am apple"
2. Participant B says: "I am banana"

**Expected**:
- ‚úÖ Each participant sees BOTH messages
- ‚úÖ Each message appears ONCE
- ‚úÖ No duplicates

**Verify in console**:
```
üì§ [TRANSCRIPT-BROADCAST] Transcript broadcasted...
üì• [TRANSCRIPT] Received broadcast, not re-broadcasting...
```

---

### Test 2: Hero Audio Not Transcribed
**Setup**: Any browser

1. Say: "Hero, what is the capital of India?"
2. Wait for Hero to respond

**Expected**:
- ‚úÖ Hero responds with "New Delhi" (or similar)
- ‚úÖ Hero's audio is NOT in the transcript
- ‚úÖ No duplicate messages

**Verify in console**:
```
‚è∏Ô∏è [STT] Paused - Hero is speaking
[Hero speaks]
‚ñ∂Ô∏è [STT] Resumed - Hero finished speaking
```

---

### Test 3: Hero General Knowledge
**Setup**: Any browser

Try these questions:
1. "Hero, what is the capital of India?"
2. "Hero, who is the prime minister of India?"
3. "Hero, what is 2+2?"

**Expected**:
- ‚úÖ Hero answers correctly using general knowledge
- ‚úÖ NOT "I don't have that information"

---

### Test 4: Speaker Names
**Setup**: 2 browsers

1. Participant "akshit" says: "hello"
2. Check transcript

**Expected**:
- ‚úÖ Shows "akshit: hello"
- ‚úÖ NOT "akshit-233b8265: hello"

---

### Test 5: Past Meeting Context
**Setup**: Any browser with existing meetings

1. Say: "Hero, can you summarize the previous meeting?"

**Expected**:
- ‚úÖ Hero searches past meetings using RAG
- ‚úÖ Provides summary if data exists
- ‚úÖ Says "I don't have information about that meeting" if no data

---

## Files Modified

1. **components/MeetingPage.tsx**
   - Added `isHeroSpeakingRef` to pause STT
   - Added `processedMessageIds` for deduplication
   - Fixed speaker name logic
   - Added STT pause/resume in Hero audio playback

2. **pages/api/hero-join.ts**
   - Updated anti-hallucination prompt
   - Separated meeting vs general knowledge rules
   - Allowed Gemini to use general knowledge

---

## Known Remaining Issues

1. **Remote video rendering**: Video tracks subscribed but not showing in DOM
   - Not blocking core functionality
   - Low priority

2. **Excessive re-renders**: ParticipantTile re-rendering frequently
   - Performance issue, not functional
   - Low priority
   - Can optimize with React.memo() later

---

## Console Log Changes

### Before Fixes:
```
üé§ [WEBSPEECH] Raw transcript: I am sorry but I do not have...
üì® [DATA] Received data: {text: 'hello'}
üé§ [WEBSPEECH] Raw transcript: hello
speaker: akshit-233b8265
Hero: I don't have that specific information
```

### After Fixes:
```
‚è∏Ô∏è [STT] Paused - Hero is speaking
[Hero audio plays]
‚ñ∂Ô∏è [STT] Resumed - Hero finished speaking
‚è≠Ô∏è [TRANSCRIPT] Skipping duplicate message: 12345
speaker: akshit
Hero: The capital of India is New Delhi.
```

---

## Performance Impact

- **Duplicate prevention**: Negligible overhead (Set lookup is O(1))
- **STT pause**: No overhead (just a boolean check)
- **LLM prompt**: Slightly longer prompt, but more accurate responses

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with 2 participants on separate devices
2. **Monitor** console logs for any issues
3. **Verify** Hero can access RAG data
4. **Check** past meeting summaries are working
5. **Optimize** re-renders if performance becomes an issue

---

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur:

1. **STT pause fix**: Remove `isHeroSpeakingRef` logic
2. **Deduplication**: Remove `processedMessageIds` logic
3. **LLM prompt**: Revert to old anti-hallucination prompt
4. **Speaker names**: Revert to using `.identity`

All changes are isolated and can be reverted independently.
