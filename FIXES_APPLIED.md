# Fixes Applied - October 15, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hero Not Responding with Context (Room is null)
**Problem**: Hero was responding with "I don't have that specific information" even when questions were asked about past meetings or general knowledge.

**Root Cause**: The `room` variable was becoming `null` due to React closure issues. When `handleHeroTrigger` was called from STT callbacks, it captured a stale `room` value from when the component first rendered.

**Solution**:
- Added `roomRef` to maintain current room reference
- Updated all broadcast functions to use `roomRef.current` instead of `room`
- Updated `handleHeroTrigger` to use `roomRef.current`
- Functions updated:
  - `broadcastHeroMessage`
  - `broadcastTranscript`
  - `addTranscript`
  - `handleHeroTrigger` (audio broadcasting section)

### 2. Transcripts Not Shared Between Participants
**Problem**: Each participant only saw their own transcripts. When Participant A spoke, Participant B didn't see it in their transcript panel.

**Root Cause**: Same as issue #1 - the `room` variable in `addTranscript` was stale, preventing transcript broadcasts from being sent via LiveKit data channel.

**Solution**:
- Updated `addTranscript` function to use `roomRef.current`
- Now when a transcript is created locally, it broadcasts to all participants via `publishData`
- Other participants receive it via the `DataReceived` event handler

## How the Fixes Work

### Room Reference Management
```typescript
const [room, setRoom] = useState<Room | null>(null);
const roomRef = useRef<Room | null>(null); // Always has current value

// Keep ref in sync with state
useEffect(() => {
  roomRef.current = room;
}, [room]);
```

### Broadcasting Pattern (Before)
```typescript
// ‚ùå BAD: Uses stale `room` from closure
if (room && room.state === 'connected') {
  await room.localParticipant.publishData(payload);
}
```

### Broadcasting Pattern (After)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Uses latest room value from ref
const currentRoom = roomRef.current;
if (currentRoom && currentRoom.state === 'connected') {
  await currentRoom.localParticipant.publishData(payload);
}
```

## What to Test

### Test 1: Hero Context & RAG
1. Open meeting as Participant A
2. Say "Hero, what is the capital of India?"
3. **Expected**: Hero should respond with "New Delhi" (or similar general knowledge)
4. Say "Hero, can you summarize the previous meeting?"
5. **Expected**: Hero should access past meeting data from RAG and provide a summary

### Test 2: Transcript Broadcasting
1. Open meeting in **Browser Tab 1** as "Alice"
2. Open **same meeting** in **Browser Tab 2** (different browser or incognito) as "Bob"
3. In Tab 1 (Alice), speak: "Hello from Alice"
4. **Expected in Tab 2 (Bob)**: Should see "Alice: Hello from Alice" in transcript panel
5. In Tab 2 (Bob), speak: "Hello from Bob"
6. **Expected in Tab 1 (Alice)**: Should see "Bob: Hello from Bob" in transcript panel

### Test 3: Hero Audio to All Participants
1. Same 2-browser setup as Test 2
2. In Tab 1 (Alice), say "Hero, what time is it?"
3. **Expected in BOTH tabs**: 
   - Both should hear Hero's TTS audio
   - Both should see Hero's response in chat
   - Console in Tab 2 should show: `ü§ñ [HERO-AUDIO] Hero TTS audio track detected!`

## Technical Details

### LiveKit Data Channel Flow
1. **Sender** (Participant A):
   - Speaks ‚Üí STT ‚Üí `addTranscript` ‚Üí `broadcastTranscript` ‚Üí `publishData()`
   
2. **LiveKit Server**:
   - Receives data ‚Üí Forwards to all participants in room
   
3. **Receiver** (Participant B):
   - `DataReceived` event ‚Üí Parse JSON ‚Üí `addTranscript(message, false)`
   - The `false` parameter prevents re-broadcasting (avoids infinite loop)

### Why This Works Now
- `roomRef.current` always points to the latest `Room` instance
- No closure issues - even if component re-renders, ref stays current
- Callbacks set up in `startTranscription` now have access to latest room

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

The RAG implementation was already working correctly. The issue was just that Hero couldn't access it because:
1. Room was null ‚Üí Couldn't broadcast responses
2. Frontend couldn't call Hero API properly

Now that room is fixed, Hero should be able to:
- Retrieve past meeting summaries from Supabase
- Use semantic search with embeddings
- Provide contextual responses based on organization history

## Files Changed
- `components/MeetingPage.tsx`: Added `roomRef` and updated all broadcasting functions

## No Breaking Changes
- All existing functionality preserved
- Only internal implementation changed to use refs
- No API or prop changes
