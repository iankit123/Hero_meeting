## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard shows empty
**Solution:** Make sure you've run the SQL schema updates in Supabase

### Issue: "Switch Organization" not working
**Solution:** Check localStorage - it should store 'hero_meeting_org'

### Issue: Past meetings not showing
**Solution:** 
1. Verify SQL schema has org_name column
2. Check that meetings were created AFTER schema update
3. Old meetings won't have org_name (they'll show up as null)

### Issue: Delete not working
**Solution:** 
1. Check Supabase RLS policies are disabled (or properly configured)
2. Verify foreign key constraints allow cascade delete
